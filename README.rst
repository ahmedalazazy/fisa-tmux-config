This is my personal tmux config. Has some graphical improvements, vim-like keybindings and fixes, and more. Look at the ``.tmux.conf`` file for more information.

Installation
============

1. Put the ``.tmux.conf`` file on you home.
2. Clone ``https://github.com/creaktive/rainbarf.git`` somwhere in your machine.
3. Enter the rainbarf repo folder, and run this to install it:
 
  ::

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

Done! Now just enter tmux :)
